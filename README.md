# Food App

This is my first React project. The Food App allows users to browse, search, and order food items online. Built with React, it demonstrates basic concepts such as components, state management, and API integration.

## Features

- Browse food items
- Search functionality
- Add items to cart
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm start`
